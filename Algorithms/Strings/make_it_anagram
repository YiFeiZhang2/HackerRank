#find min number of deletions in two strings to make them anagrams of each other
#used defaultdict to store number of occurences of characters in strings
#+1 for first string, -1 for second
#in the end, the value for each character key represents the difference
#sum of the absolute of the difference of each key is the total number of characters that need to be changed
